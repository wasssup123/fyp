this fyp project is focus on using AI model for DNA, which based on the four nucleotide of DNA, with the use of Given NCBI dataset by supervisor
vit fusion with distillation.ipynb and CNN model compare between mer.ipynb will be the main focus in this repo

vit fusion with distillation.ipynb focus on how to get high accuracy in a dataset that have serious class imbalance and large number of classes lack of data points, with the use of multistage knowledge distillation and custom loss function


CNN model compare between mer.ipynb focus on bit quantization, as a simpler model but still relatively high accuracy, act as a proof of concept in bit quantization for model for DNA classification
