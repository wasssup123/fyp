    "Overview:\n",
    "Some models combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformer layers to capture both local and global features. CNNs naturally incorporate a form of positional sensitivity through their receptive fields and can act as feature extractors before a transformer or recurrent network processes the data.\n",

    "DeepSEA:\n",
    "While not strictly about encoding, DeepSEA uses convolutional architectures to predict chromatin effects from sequence data. Its design highlights how local pattern detection (motifs) can be effectively combined with downstream prediction tasks."
